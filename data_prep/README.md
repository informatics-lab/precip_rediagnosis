# Data Preparation
The contents of this directory are all about extracting and preprocessing data from the Met Office archive and other sources for the precipitation rediagnosis. In general we are seeking to match ensemble model output  with assorted sources of ground truth  for UK rainfall.

Current data sources:
* [UK Met Office MOGREPS-G ensemble](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/ensemble-forecasting/mogreps)
* [UK Met Office Rainfall Radar](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/observation/rainfall-radar)
